# WEBMAX Desktop for Linux/Windows (unofficial)
MAX Linux client built with Electron (used Electron-21.0.1). Here is an unofficial build (because as an official MAX it is written poorly). 
It is fork from WhatsApp-Desktop-Linux that's written by Alberto Mimbrero [releases page](https://github.com/mimbrero/whatsapp-desktop-linux).

## 📜 Disclaimer
This just loads https://web.max.ru/ with some extra features, but never changing the content of the official webpage (html, css nor javascript). 

This wrapper is not verified by, affiliated with, or supported by MAX Inc.
